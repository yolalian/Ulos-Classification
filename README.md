# Ulos-Classification

Title: Klasifikasi Ulos Batak Berdasarkan Etnis Menggunakan Pendekatan Convolutional Neural Network. 

This project is developed in collaboration with group members, and the overall research outcome has resulted in a journal paper that will be published. The classification of Batak Ulos in this project utilizes a dataset of 600 self-captured photos, categorized into six ethnic classes: 'Batak_Karo,' 'Batak_Toba,' 'Batak_Simalungun,' 'Batak_Mandailing,' 'Batak_PakPak,' and 'Batak_Angkola.'
